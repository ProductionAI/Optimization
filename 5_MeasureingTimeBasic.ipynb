    "# Important Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Data Size: The size of your training and test data significantly impacts the times.  Run with representative data.\n",
    "# - Model Complexity: More complex models (e.g., deep neural networks) will take longer to train and predict.\n",
    "# - Hardware:  Your CPU, RAM, and whether you're using a GPU will affect the times.\n",
    "# - Averaging: It's a good practice to run the timing multiple times and average the results to reduce the impact of system variations. You can use a loop for this.\n",
    "# - First Prediction: Often, the *very first* prediction can take slightly longer due to initialization overhead.  It's a good idea to do a \"warm-up\" prediction before starting your actual timing measurements.\n",
    "# - Batch Size (for prediction): When making predictions, especially with neural networks, processing data in batches is often more efficient.  Experiment with different batch sizes.\n",
    "# - Profiling: For more detailed analysis, consider using a code profiler (e.g., `cProfile` in Python) to see exactly where the time is being spent within the training or prediction process.\n",
