    "Evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) models is distinct from supervised or unsupervised learning due to the sequential decision-making nature of RL. Here's a breakdown of key metrics and considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cumulative Reward:\n",
    "This is the most fundamental metric. It's the total reward an agent accumulates over an episode or a series of episodes.\n",
    "It directly reflects how well the agent is achieving its goal.\n",
    "## Average Reward:\n",
    "This provides a more stable measure, especially when episode lengths vary.\n",
    "It's calculated by averaging the rewards obtained per time step or per episode.\n",
    "Discounted Cumulative Reward:\n",
    "In many RL scenarios, future rewards are discounted. This metric accounts for the time value of rewards.\n",
    "It's useful for evaluating how well an agent balances immediate and long-term rewards.\n",
    "## Episode Length:\n",
    "The number of steps an agent takes to complete an episode.\n",
    "It can indicate the efficiency of the agent's policy.\n",
    "## Success Rate:\n",
    "In tasks with a clear definition of success or failure, this metric measures the percentage of episodes where the agent achieves the goal.\n",
    "## Sample Efficiency:\n",
    "Measures how many interactions with the environment the agent requires to learn an effective policy.\n",
    "Important when environment interactions are costly or time-consuming.\n",
    "## Robustness:\n",
    "How well the agent performs in varying or unexpected environments.\n",
    "Testing the agents ability to generalize.\n",
    "## Policy Entropy:\n",
    "Measures the randomness of the agent's policy.\n",
    "Higher entropy can encourage exploration, while lower entropy indicates a more deterministic policy."
